									<h2><a href="#">Who am I?</a></h2>
									<p>Hi, I'm Frank, a games engineering student at Newcastle University. What makes me passionate about games is the<br />
									uniqueness and variety of the medium and the sense that you're really working towards something during their <br />
									creation. While I had been dabbling in games engineering in my earlier years, I chose to pursue a career in the <br />
									industry after a programming project in Sixth Form which I found myself genuinely passionate and excited about,<br />
									something I hadn't really experienced in my other subjects. Most of my games engineering experience so far has been <br />
									working with the Unity games engine and programming in C#, but I'm happy to learn other languages and engines in<br />
									preparation for and during my industry placement.
									</p>
