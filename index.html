									<h2>Who am I?</a></h2>
									<p>Hi, I'm Frank, a games engineering student at Newcastle University. My interest in pursuing<br>
									a career in the games industry was ignited during my A Level programming project. I found myself<br>
									genuinely excited about working on it and was able to make something I was really proud of. I<br>
									love the uniqueness and variety of the medium and the sense that you're really working towards<br>
									an end goal during the creation process. Most of my games engineering experience so far has<br>
									been working with the Unity games engine and programming in C#, but Iâ€™d be more than happy to<br>
									learn other languages and engines in preparation for and during my industry placement. I also<br>
									have lots of experience working with Python and am in the process of learning Java and C through<br>
									formal study at Newcastle.</p>
