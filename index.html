									<h2>Who am I?</a></h2>
									<p>Hi, I'm Frank, a games engineering student at Newcastle University. The things I love about creating computer games<br>
									are the uniqueness and variety of the medium and the sense that you’re really working towards an end goal during the<br>
									creation process. Although I’d dabbled in coding, my interest in pursuing a career in the games industry was fully<br>
									ignited during my A Level programming project. I found myself genuinely excited about working on it and was able to<br>
									make something I was really proud of.  Most of my games engineering experience so far has been working with the Unity<br>
									games engine and programming in C#, but I’d be more than happy to learn other languages and engines in preparation for<br>
									and during my industry placement.
									</p>
